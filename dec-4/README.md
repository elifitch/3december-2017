# three-boilerplate
A modern boilerplate for three.js projects ðŸŽ‰

I whipped this up as a convenient starting point that will make three.js and shader development easier.  Clone and you're ready to go with webpack, babel, GLSLify, a hot reloading dev server and a basic three.js scene including some extremely basic GLSLified shaders.

## Features
* Three.js & orbit controls
* GLSLify for easy shader development
* Builds with webpack
* Hot reloading dev server

## Future
* Turn it into a CLI since that's a thing people do now
